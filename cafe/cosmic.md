#### **Abilities**

- **Strength (STR):** 8 (-1)  
  Lifting planetary burdens? No. Lifting her cosmic tiara? Maybe.
- **Dexterity (DEX):** 14 (+2)  
  Graceful pirouettes in zero gravity.
- **Constitution (CON):** 10 (+0)  
  Handles adversity like a star… _occasionally imploding_.
- **Intelligence (INT):** 12 (+1)  
  Knows the names of every star, and her star charts have a glitter theme.
- **Wisdom (WIS):** 10 (+0)  
  Occasionally wise, but prone to existential crises like, "Why does Pluto even matter if it’s not a planet anymore?"
- **Charisma (CHA):** 18 (+4)  
  Commands attention in every galaxy. Radiates glittering cosmic fabulousness.

#### **Skills**

- **Diplomacy:** +10 ("I decree that all disputes can be solved by _chill vibes_ and sparkles!")
- **Perform (Celestial Dance):** +8 (Her space ballet has literally caused supernovas.)
- **Knowledge (Arcana):** +6 ("Oh, honey, that's not a black hole, it's just _aesthetic_.")

---

#### **Traits**

- **Celestial Glow:** Gains a +2 bonus to Charisma-based checks when in low-light or starlit environments (because she _shines_ in the dark).

---

#### **Equipment**

- **Cosmic Tiara:** Provides a +1 bonus to Will saves, but it’s really all about the look.

---

- **Astral Command (Su):** Once per day, summons a shooting star to smite her enemies (and provide dramatic lighting).
- **Galaxy Whispers (Ex):** Can hear the secrets of the cosmos—though she interprets them as compliments.
- **Cosmic Diva (Su):** Can unleash a melodramatic monologue that gives allies +2 to morale saves while enemies take -2 to Concentration checks (because they’re rolling their eyes too hard).
