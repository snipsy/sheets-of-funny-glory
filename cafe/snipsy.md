# **"Snipsy Zenith" - Human Alchemist 4 (Drama Queen of the Future Edition)**

**Alignment:** Chaotic Fabulous (She doesn’t follow rules. She makes them. And they sparkle.)  
**Race:** Kitsune (_But better_, because she upgraded herself with tech—and better fashion.)  
**Class:** Alchemist (with a minor in "blinding people with her awesomeness")  
**Deity:** Herself (obviously; the universe wouldn’t dare worship anyone else)  
**Age:** ??? (Every time someone asks, she just smirks and says, “timeless.”)

#### **Abilities**

- **Strength (STR):** 14 (+2)  
  Strong enough to carry this entire party’s lack of style, not to mention her oversized, glittery plasma gauntlets.
- **Dexterity (DEX):** 20 (+5)  
  Dodges lasers, awkward pickup lines, _and_ tax questions with effortless grace.
- **Constitution (CON):** 12 (+1)  
  Holds her ground in battle _and_ when dealing with the haters in her DMs.
- **Intelligence (INT):** 18 (+4)  
  Built an exo-suit that can obliterate robots, fry eggs, and play “Viva la Vida” in Dolby surround sound.
- **Wisdom (WIS):** 8 (-1)  
  Makes terrible life choices—but _damn_ does she look good doing it.
- **Charisma (CHA):** 25 (+7)  
  Causes instant nosebleeds and existential crises wherever she goes.

#### **Skills**

- **Diplomacy:** +12 (“Oh, sweetie, don’t cry. I’m _only_ too good for you.”)
- **Intimidate:** +10 (Her battle glare alone has ended galactic wars. And don’t even _look_ at her heels wrong.)
- **Craft (Drama):** +15 (Creates tension wherever she enters, paired with an invisible wind machine.)
- **Perform (Saucy Wink):** +14 (Targets any individual within 30 ft. Save DC: Impossible.)

---

#### **Feats**

- **Skill Focus (Flirting):** When teasing, enemies must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or become flustered for 1d4 rounds.
- **Weapon Finesse (Sass):** Her sharp tongue hits harder than her plasma blasts.
- **Disarming Smile:** Once per encounter, forces an opponent to drop their weapon because they were too busy swooning.

---

#### **Traits**

- **Fashion Icon:** Gains a +2 bonus to Bluff and Intimidate when her outfit involves at least one item with rhinestones.
- **Over-the-Top Entrance:** Always arrives to combat in slow motion with epic theme music, imposing a -2 morale penalty to all foes who _cannot handle her energy._

---

#### **Equipment**

- **"Zenith Armor" (Limited Edition):** Custom-made exo-suit with holographic LED trim and a built-in speaker system that only plays Beyoncé’s greatest hits.
  - _Functionality:_ Provides +6 AC, allows flight, and blinds enemies when it sparkles in combat.
- **Plasma Gauntlets (Trademark Pending):** Fists of power charged with sass and a side of fire damage.
- **Holo-Heels (4-inch stilettos):** She can still high-kick in these bad boys, increasing movement speed by 10 ft.

---

#### **Special Abilities**

- **Fluster Aura (Su):** Enemies within 10 feet must make a DC 18 Will save every round or take a -2 penalty to attack rolls due to sheer distraction.
- **Snapback Blast (Ex):** Once per combat, she can unleash a devastating comeback so savage it deals 2d6 psychic damage to an enemy’s ego.
- **Starlight Strut (Su):** Once per day, Snipsy strikes a pose so dazzling that enemies must avert their gaze (blinded for 1d4 rounds) while allies gain a +2 morale bonus because they’re in awe of her fabulousness.

### **Snipsy Zenith’s Motto:**

“I didn’t save the galaxy because I had to—I did it because nobody else looked as good doing it.”
