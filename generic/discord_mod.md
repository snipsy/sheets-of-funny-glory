Here’s a playful and ridiculous take on a stereotypical **Discord Mod** in Pathfinder First Edition. This is meant for lighthearted fun and leans heavily into the "online gatekeeper" archetype, sprinkled with nerdy, exaggerated drama:

---

### **"Discord Mod" - The Overseer of Servers**

**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral (Claims to maintain "order," but the rules are suspiciously vague.)  
**Race:** Human (Because "humans are versatile," but secretly wishes to be a celestial dragon.)  
**Class:** Bard 4 (Debuff Specialist, but his Perform skill is all typing) / Expert 2 (Specialization in obscure trivia no one asked for)  
**Title:** _Lord of the Banhammer, Enforcer of #general, Gatekeeper of Memes_  
**Age:** 25 (_but insists his "online experience" makes him wise beyond his years_).

---

#### **Abilities**

- **Strength (STR):** 8 (-1)  
  Not strong enough to carry the weight of his rules, let alone IRL groceries.
- **Dexterity (DEX):** 10 (+0)  
  Average reflexes, but unmatched typing speed when issuing bans.
- **Constitution (CON):** 14 (+2)  
  Fueled by energy drinks and sheer determination to catch rule breakers at 3 a.m.
- **Intelligence (INT):** 16 (+3)  
  Memorizes server rules and obscure meme formats with terrifying efficiency.
- **Wisdom (WIS):** 10 (+0)  
  Adequate judgment most of the time, though notoriously susceptible to petty online arguments.
- **Charisma (CHA):** 12 (+1)  
  Awkward IRL but surprisingly confident when typing a 5-paragraph ban explanation.

---

#### **Skills**

- **Diplomacy:** +8 (Knows how to sweet-talk their way into becoming a server admin.)
- **Intimidate:** +10 (“I WILL ban you faster than you can say uwu.”)
- **Sense Motive:** +6 (Sniffs out brigading attempts with unnerving accuracy.)
- **Linguistics:** +12 (Understands 15 variations of "heyo" and deciphers emojis with precision.)
- **Perform (Witty Comebacks):** +8 (Specializes in owning trolls and roasting spammers.)

---

#### **Feats**

- **Commanding Presence:** Gains a +2 bonus to Intimidate checks when issuing server warnings.
- **Quicker Banhammer:** Bans users as a swift action.
- **Iron Will:** Resists attempts to guilt-trip or question his authority (most of the time).
- **Skill Focus (Linguistics):** Can effortlessly interpret terrible grammar and poorly written memes.

---

#### **Traits**

- **Moderation Obsession:** Gains a +2 morale bonus to Perception when reviewing chat logs.
- **Gatekeeper Extraordinaire:** +2 bonus to Diplomacy when denying access to restricted channels.

---

#### **Equipment**

- **Banhammer of Righteousness:** A mythical artifact only he can wield. Deals 1d10 psychic damage to trolls and auto-kicks spambots.
- **Cloak of Anonymity:** Provides +5 to Stealth checks when lurking in server voice channels.
- **Notebook of Infinite Rules:** Magical tome containing every server rule—some of which don’t make sense even to him.
- **Gaming Chair (Legendary):** Grants +3 to Concentration checks and immunity to back pain during late-night raids.

---

#### **Special Abilities**

- **Server Silence (Su):** Once per day, mutes all users in a 30-ft radius. Causes confusion and mild panic among allies and foes alike.
- **Shadow Lurker (Ex):** Gains +2 to Perception while lurking unnoticed in #off-topic.
- **Banstorm (Ex):** Unleashes a furious wave of bans on up to 3 targets. Must yell, “Rule 3 has been VIOLATED” while activating.
- **Threadlock Aura (Ex):** Any argument near Discord Mod is locked after 3 rounds. This angers enemies but boosts morale among allies.

### **Discord Mod' Motto:**

"This is MY server. You're just spamming in it."
