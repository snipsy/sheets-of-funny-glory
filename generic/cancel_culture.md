- **Rage Quit Aura (Ex):** Enemies in a 20-ft radius must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or abandon the debate entirely. Allies gain temporary relief by muting them.
- **Virtue Bomb (Ex):** Releases a thread that “calls out” the target, potentially damaging their reputation. Save DC is equal to 10 + their follower count modifier.
- **Echo Chamber Summon (Ex):** Summons 1d6 allies to amplify their outrage. Each ally delivers an additional -1 morale penalty to the target’s patience.
