**Race:** Elf/Deity (Because “divine” is her default state of being)  
**Class:** Druid 20 / Homemaker Extraordinaire 5 (multi-class because her kids _are_ the wild animals)  
**Deity Title:** _The Whale-form Wonder, Empress of ADHD Tangents, Queen of Cozy Chaos_  
**Age:** Eternal, but will tell you she’s been “perpetually 29.”

#### **Abilities**

- **Strength (STR):** 20 (+5)  
  Who needs gym memberships when you’ve carried toddlers, groceries, and the world on your shoulders?
- **Dexterity (DEX):** 14 (+2)  
  Graceful when dodging child-propelled projectiles. Less graceful when spinning into hyperfocus mode.
- **Constitution (CON):** 22 (+6)

  Knows everything about plants, animals, and the perfect ratio of cheese-to-breadcrumbs for casseroles.
- **Wisdom (WIS):** 25 (+7)  
  A bottomless well of nature’s knowledge and mom instincts. (Also great at noticing that suspicious silence from the next room.)
- **Charisma (CHA):** 24 (+7)  
  Radiates such warm, nurturing energy that even enemies are like, “Aw, she’s nice—OH NO, IS THAT A WHALE?!”

#### **Skills**

- **Knowledge (Nature):** +20 (Knows the names of _every mushroom_, but can’t remember where she left her car keys.)
- **Craft (Snacks):** +18 (Transcends the limits of mortal snack platters.)
- **Diplomacy:** +15 (“Use your words, honey, before Mommy shifts into dire bear mode again.”)
- **Survival:** +17 (Wrangles toddlers, laundry, and forest fires without breaking a sweat.)

#### **Feats**

- **Whale-Fu Mastery:** Crushes foes with hilariously inconvenient whale shapes while remaining completely serene.
- **Mom Voice:** Forces all within a 30-ft radius to freeze in place. Effectively ends sibling squabbles _and_ combat. No saving throw allowed.
- **Infinite Patience:** Immune to tantrum-induced stress effects.
- **Improved Multitasking:** Can command animals, heal allies, and prepare dinner _simultaneously_.

---

#### **Traits**

- **Autistic Positivity Aura:** Allies within 20 feet gain a +2 morale bonus when embracing their quirks, and enemies who make fun of neurodivergence are struck with _Blinding Shame_.
- **ADHD Energizer:** Gains +10 ft movement speed when rushing between tasks, but she might forget why she started running halfway there.
- **Wholesome Chaos:** Her divine aura leaves a trail of leaves, wildflowers, and the occasional raccoon.

---

#### **Equipment**

- **Mom Apron of Holding:** Contains snacks, first aid supplies, and at least one confused opossum.
- **Bottomless Coffee Cup:** Negates fatigue effects and provides a morale boost to all allies who smell the divine brew.
- **Scepter of Play-Doh Wrangling:** Functions as a staff of the woodlands but can also scoop toys into a basket like magic.

#### **Special Abilities**

- **Whaleform Doom (Ex):** Camilla can transform into a _ginormous whale_ in any space, regardless of how small. Enemies must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 25) or be crushed under **20 tons of maternal vengeance**. Even allies stare in awe.
- **ADHD Frenzy (Su):** Once per day, Camilla hyperfocuses on a task, gaining double actions for 1 minute. When finished, she immediately forgets where she left her scepter.
- **Empathic Animal Whisperer (Su):** Camilla can communicate with animals telepathically. Birds gossip, raccoons ask for snacks, and cats deliver scathing opinions on her choice of decor.
- **Nature’s Snuggle (Ex):** Camilla can summon a giant cuddly bear (or any woodland creature) to comfort and distract allies during combat. Provides healing and a morale bonus because _fluffy hugs fix everything_.

### **Camilla’s Motto:**

“Remember, kids: The circle of life is beautiful—except when Mommy has to squish someone with a whale.”
