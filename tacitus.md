# **"Tacitus" - The Weapon Hoarder with a Blunt Edge**

**Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral (His moral compass spins as wildly as his sleep schedule.)  
**Race:** Human (Because only humans juggle this level of chaos without breaking.)  
**Class:** Fighter 5 / Monk 3 (_Punching and slashing his way through the sleepless night._)  
**Title:** _"Collector of Blades, Sleepless Scholar, ADHD Arsenal on Legs"_  
**Age:** Early 30s (but those chronic insomnia circles under his eyes say "ancient warrior").

#### **Abilities**

- **Strength (STR):** 16 (+3)  
  Can carry multiple swords, a halberd, two axes, and his last shred of sanity.
- **Dexterity (DEX):** 18 (+4)  
  Has reflexes so sharp, he once dodged a falling bookshelf _while reading_.
- **Constitution (CON):** 14 (+2)  
  Runs on adrenaline, caffeine, and spite toward anyone who tells him to "just get some sleep."
- **Intelligence (INT):** 16 (+3)  
  A walking encyclopedia of weaponry and martial arts, though he sometimes uses those smarts to roast people mid-fight.
- **Wisdom (WIS):** 8 (-1)  
  Can recite entire combat theories… yet forgets why he walked into a room.
- **Charisma (CHA):** 12 (+1)  
  His blunt honesty and deep weapon knowledge are oddly endearing. That, or people are scared to disagree with him.

#### **Skills**

- **Knowledge (Weapons):** +15 ("That’s not just a sword. That’s a 12th-century longsword from the Highbridge Era—let me give you an _hour-long_ history lesson about it.")
- **Diplomacy:** +6 (Talks down blacksmiths for better prices—or up just to hype their craft.)
- **Sense Motive:** -2 (ADHD makes it tricky to read people. He assumes everyone’s lying just to save mental effort.)
- **Craft (Weaponsmithing):** +12 (Can repair, enhance, and _sometimes accidentally improve_ weapons mid-battle.)
- **Perform (Weapon Show-Off):** +10 (Throws daggers for dramatic effect because _why not_.)

#### **Feats**

- **Quick Draw:** Tacitus can whip out any weapon from his arsenal faster than someone can blink.
- **Weapon Specialization:** His favorite weapons? Deadlier than your average blade.
- **Flurry of Madness:** Combines martial arts strikes with wild weapon attacks, creating a storm of blades, fists, and havoc.
- **Endurance:** Insomnia hasn’t broken him yet—and he’ll take a nap when the universe ends.

---

#### **Traits**

- **Restless Scholar:** Gains a +2 bonus to Knowledge checks when researching weapon designs or martial arts techniques, but loses track of time completely.
- **ADHD Weapon Obsession:** Whenever Tacitus gets a new weapon, he hyperfixates for 1d4 hours, perfecting his skills with it. He’s probably using that time to name it, too.
- **Blunt Honesty:** His no-nonsense remarks are so brutal they might as well be crits to someone’s self-esteem.

#### **Equipment**

- **Tacitus’ Arsenal Cloak:** A custom-made cloak stuffed with weapons. Somewhere in its folds is a family-sized bag of coffee beans.
- **Weapon of the Week™:** Tacitus always carries one weapon that’s excessively impractical but _ridiculously cool._ (Think: a double-bladed scythe or a sword you have to reload.)
- **Boots of Stomping:** Because sometimes the right step makes an entrance _and_ cracks a jaw.
- **Bookish Armory:** His leather satchel is a mix of ancient weapon blueprints, random paperbacks, and at least one half-eaten granola bar.

#### **Special Abilities**

- **Sleepless Efficiency (Ex):** Tacitus doesn’t suffer penalties from going without rest. Instead, his insomnia adds +1 to Initiative during nighttime battles.
- **Flurry of Chaos (Ex):** Once per encounter, Tacitus unleashes a blinding series of strikes and weapon attacks on up to 3 nearby enemies. His moves look like an interpretive dance of destruction.
- **Weapon Whisperer (Su):** Tacitus can sense the "soul" of a weapon and always knows its history—whether the weapon _wants_ him to know or not.
- **Book Barrage (Ex):** Can throw his books (usually for dramatic effect). Deals 1d4 damage per hardback and a hefty dose of confusion.

### **Tacitus’ Motto:**

“Sleep is for the sane. Books and weapons? Now _that’s_ my idea of bedtime comfort.”
